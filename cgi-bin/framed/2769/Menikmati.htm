    <p> <font color="#FF3333">I was so excited when I got my hands on this amazing
      video mainley because of all the hype about it. I had also watched the trailer
      for it about 50 times. I pull it out of the case only to see the tape is
      a bright red. Nice touch! The intro was very nicely done and well coordinated
      with the music. Arto's part is first . In the beggining of his part it shows
      some famous skate spots which have been made un-skateable. Then his part
      explodes into action. Arto killed everything he skated. Everything is so
      clean even his switch f/s boardslides down BIG handrails. Following Arto's
      part is Ronnie Creagers. He had a nice laid back style but I wish his part
      was a little bit longer. Next came Rodrigo Tx. Rodrigo can skate switch
      just as well as he can regular. Example, Switch kickflip f/s boardslide
      down a hand rail. Following Rodrigo's part is a touring section showing
      some little demos they had done. After that was Tom Penny's part which was
      a bunch of his old clips in black and white. It was amazing to see how laid
      back someone can skate and how easy they made everything look. Rick McCranks
      part was incredible especially with his indian style music. It was my favorite
      part of the whole video. His last trick was a 5050 kickflip out on this
      huge ledge. It blew me away. Following Rick's part was Bob Burnquist who
      pulled out some crazy manouvers. Next came Eric Kostons part which you'll
      have to just see for yourself. The end of the video was highly comical.
      Some thing si really liked about this video were the editing was very good
      (In Kostons part especially), The music was good (All instrumental stuff..
      no lyricsin any of the songs) and the skating was at a very high level.
      Some of the parts seem to drag on and on but overall it was one of the best
      videos i have seen in a long time. It really gets you hyped to skate. A
      must buy video!</font></p>
