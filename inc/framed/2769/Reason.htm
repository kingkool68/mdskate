    <p> <font color="#FF3333">I've had this video for a while. When I first watched
      it, I couldn't believe my eyes. The skating, editing, and music all blended
      together beautifully. Everything, I mean EVERYTHING, was on beat. Every
      trick was landed on beat to the music. This video is what inspired me to
      edit video the way i do. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF3333">The video starts off with an awsome intro-montage
      to the music of Coldcut. Gershon Mosley starts it off with the first part.
      His music is hard hitting just like his skating. He does big stuff skating
      switch. His part was good, but the video gets much better as it continues
      onward. Cairo Foster follows with his incredible part with alot of switch
      hardflips. The video takes a short break filled with some comic relief followed
      by a16mm montage. This guy gets the biggest air off of a bank i have ever
      seen. He goes off frame. Anyways, Danny Montoya's part was extremely teched
      out. Lots of long lines finally ending with a nollie halfcab to frontside
      5-0 down a handrail. After this, Danny Gonzales. He does some unusual stuff
      (ex: switch 3 flip foot plant on tree, 180 one wheelie manual, Sex change
      one footed manual, and sex change nose manual) Another montage follows with
      commercial clips showing the popularity skateboarding has gained. Moses
      Itkonen (with appearences by Paul Machnau, Colin McKay, and Rick McCrank)
      is just sick. This guy tears up the Canada parks and streets. After that
      is the nastiest injury section. Neal Mims had a real nasty one. All i can
      say if this doesn't make you squirm, you must be dead. Next up is Stevie
      Williams with his magical LOVE park part. He just flat out kills it. Matt
      Mumford finishes off the video with his all black and white part. Quite
      Scary. He kills handrails and big gaps. His last trick, Smith grind the
      el toro rail, first try as rumors have it. The end section is my favorite
      part of the whole video. It features all the funny stuff. So all in all
      this video is one of the best. It defines how skateboard videos will be
      made from here on out. It's well worth the money and a very good one to
      watch before hitting up a session. </font></p>
